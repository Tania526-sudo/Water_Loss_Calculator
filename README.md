# Water_Loss_Calculator
This project is a C++ application designed for automated water loss calculation in case of pipeline damage. The software replaces manual calculations by implementing a graphical interface that allows users to enter parameters such as pipe damage radius, pressure, and time duration of the accident to compute water loss efficiently.
